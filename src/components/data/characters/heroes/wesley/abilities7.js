    name: "Vibrational Discrepancy Awareness",
    books: [3],
    description:
      "Wesley can detect inconsistencies in the vibrational patterns of his environment, allowing him to sense—and often visually perceive—when something is an illusion, projection, or reality distortion. Because every object and entity emits a subtle vibrational signature, any artificial construct or manipulated image typically carries slight inconsistencies in frequency, resonance, or delay.\n\nBy constantly attuning to these micro-vibrations, Wesley can feel when something is out of phase with the world around it. This awareness often presents as a distortion, shimmer, or absence of expected feedback in his senses—making illusions harder to fool him with and enabling him to “see through” them even when others can’t. While not infallible against all types of illusions, especially those that manipulate vibration directly, his ability gives him a significant edge against deceptive abilities and reality-altering foes.",

    name: "Vibration Echo Barrage",
    books: [3],
    description:
      "Wesley delivers a single punch laced with staggered vibrational frequencies, causing it to detonate in a cascade of overlapping concussive impacts. Instead of one strike, the vibrations ripple forward in rapid succession, layering dozens—sometimes hundreds—of micro-shockwaves along the same path. The result is a barrage of phantom hits all focused on a single impact zone, overwhelming even the most durable targets with relentless internal pressure and kinetic trauma.",
  },
  {
    name: "Mass Distortion Strikes",
    books: [3],
    description:
      "Wesley manipulates the vibrational frequency and momentum of his limbs to simulate the kinetic mass of far heavier objects. By momentarily syncing his strikes with the resonant signature of something massive—like a boulder, a vehicle, or even a meteor—he tricks the laws of motion into amplifying the weight behind each blow.\n\nThis doesn’t make him physically heavier, but rather makes his strike land with the force of something that is. The result is a punch or kick that carries catastrophic inertia, capable of blowing through reinforced barriers, launching foes across vast distances, or shattering defensive constructs in a single hit. At full output, the backlash from these strikes can cause shockwaves or fracture the terrain underfoot, making them risky to use in unstable environments.",
  },
  {
    name: "Vibration Force Multiplier",
    books: [3],
    description:
      "Wesley unleashes a series of vibration-based attacks that compound in strength with each successive strike. By syncing the frequency of each blast to the residual vibrations left by the previous one, he amplifies the kinetic feedback loop—causing every hit to grow stronger, faster, and more destabilizing than the last. This buildup continues until the final strike delivers exponentially enhanced concussive force, often overwhelming even the most resilient defenses.\n\nThe multiplier effect only works when attacks are executed in rapid succession, making this technique a high-reward combat rhythm that punishes hesitation or interruption. At full potential, the last strike in the sequence can trigger area-wide shockwaves, shatter reinforced constructs, or rupture internal systems in vibration-sensitive targets.",

  {
    name: "Vibration Armor",
    books: [3],
    description:
      "Wesley can rapidly form makeshift armor by gathering debris, rubble, or nearby environmental materials and binding them together using controlled vibrational fields. These oscillating frequencies stabilize loose fragments into a cohesive, flexible shell that absorbs impact and redistributes kinetic force across the surface.\n\nThe armor is not a solid plate—it’s a reactive layer held together by continuous micro-vibrations, allowing it to flex, shift, and adapt with Wesley’s movements. It can be formed mid-combat, often while he's using concussive blasts from a single arm or leg to stay upright. This makes the technique especially effective when Wesley is injured and needs quick reinforcement, such as after sustaining major limb damage.\n\nDepending on available materials, the armor may appear jagged, layered, or rough—but its vibrational cohesion renders it surprisingly resilient. The more stable Wesley’s aura, the longer it holds together; too much disruption or external destabilization may cause it to break apart.",

    name: "Vibro-Inertial Displacement Surge",
    books: [3],
    description:
      "In the vacuum of space, where traditional movement systems fail, Wesley weaponizes vibration itself. By generating a focused internal recoil—originating from a synchronized pulse of vibrational energy across his muscular and skeletal structure—he launches himself at extreme speeds without relying on external propulsion. This sudden surge propels him like a human railgun, converting zero-gravity into a combat advantage.\n\nThe move distorts light and local debris as he breaks forward, becoming a streak of vibrational force capable of blitzing across starship fields or tearing through fleets. Because it bypasses conventional thruster drag, the technique allows for tight maneuvering, precision bursts, or devastating strike entries from unexpected vectors.",
  },
  {
    name: "Zero-State Vibration Control",
    books: [3],
    description:
      "Wesley enters a hyper-refined state where his body’s vibrations are perfectly stabilized at a harmonic equilibrium, severing his connection to conventional inertia. In this zero-state, he effectively removes all internal resistance to motion—allowing him to move using only the recoil of his own vibrational emissions, with no drag, slowdown, or external friction acting on him.\n\nThis state enables silent, instantaneous redirection in zero-G, extreme-speed bursts without traditional acceleration, and even temporary “suspension” from the normal laws of motion. It’s particularly effective in space or high-pressure atmospheres, where traditional movement would falter.",

    description:
      "Trained from a young age by his uncle Teddy Johnson—Wesley developed an elite-level proficiency in cyber-infiltration. Under Teddy’s hands-on tutelage, he learned to breach firewalls, override encrypted systems, disrupt live surveillance networks, and manipulate AI protocols with precision.\n\nBut the student didn’t just learn—he surpassed the master by a mile. In time, Wesley became one of the most dangerous and untraceable hackers on the planet, capable of outmaneuvering government systems, disabling alien tech, and bringing military infrastructure to its knees in seconds. His blend of instinctual logic, speed, and tactical brilliance makes him nearly impossible to oppose in the digital realm.",

      "Trained extensively by his father Ajax Johnson—a renowned soldier and combat tactician—Wesley is a master of multiple martial arts disciplines. His fighting style is an evolving synthesis of Krav Maga, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, boxing, kickboxing, and jujutsu, each integrated seamlessly into his approach based on the threat and terrain. From grapples and throws to strikes and pressure-point counters, he’s equipped for nearly any scenario. What sets Wesley apart is how he fuses technique with his vibrational abilities, using timing, flow, and environmental control to amplify even the most basic move.",

Mentored by both Ajax and Teddy Johnson, he learned to approach combat and mission planning like a chessboard: seeing angles others miss, accounting for probabilities in real time, and making split-second decisions under pressure.\n\nHis mind operates like a predictive engine—analyzing patterns, anticipating enemy moves, and adjusting tactics mid-conflict. Whether in solo operations or team leadership roles, Wesley’s plans are precise, layered, and often two steps ahead of everyone else. His anxiety, once a burden, now sharpens his awareness—fueling a hyper-intuitive combat sense that borders on precognition.\n\nWhen things fall apart, Wesley doesn’t panic. He recalculates—and wins.",
